# E-Commerce-Customer-Behavior-Personalization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to analyze e-commerce customer behavior and implement personalized recommendations. It consists of two phases:

- **Phase 1:** Developed a **stacked Random Forest (RF) + Gradient Boosting (GB) model**, achieving **96.13% accuracy** for predicting customer behavior.
- **Phase 2:** Improved accuracy to **97.62%** using **Cluster Boost** and implemented **personalized recommendations** to enhance customer experience.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Customer behavior prediction using machine learning  
✅ Stacked ensemble model (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting)  
✅ Enhanced accuracy with Cluster Boost  
✅ Personalized product recommendations  
✅ Scalable and adaptable for real-world e-commerce platforms
