📖 Overview
The Cluster Boost Model is an advanced ensemble learning approach designed to enhance customer behavior analysis in e-commerce. This model builds upon stacking techniques to improve prediction accuracy and personalization.

🔍 Key Features
📊 Combines Clustering & Boosting: Uses clustering techniques to group similar customers and applies a boosting model for refined predictions.
🚀 Higher Accuracy: Achieves 97.62% accuracy, surpassing traditional models.
🔄 Adaptive Learning: Leverages cluster-based segmentation to optimize personalization strategies.

🏗 Model Architecture

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Uses median imputation for reviews_per_month.

2️⃣ Feature Engineering
Creates new features based on customer interaction patterns.
Employs one-hot encoding and dimensionality reduction.

3️⃣ Clustering Analysis
Groups customers using K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering.
Determines optimal clusters based on Silhouette Scores.

4️⃣ Boosting Model (Cluster Boost)
Uses Gradient Boosting (GB) to make predictions within each cluster.
Assigns different weightages to clusters based on past behavior.

5️⃣ Evaluation & Metrics
Assesses performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Compares against baseline models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

🛠 How to Run
Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Run all cells in phase2_cluster_boost_model.ipynb.
Review performance metrics and cluster visualizations.

📌 Conclusion
The Cluster Boost Model effectively enhances customer behavior predictions, helping e-commerce businesses deliver better recommendations and personalized experiences.
